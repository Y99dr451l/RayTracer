# RayTracer
Raytracer following the "[Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io)" series by Peter Shirley, adding (in chronological order):
- jpg/png output using [stb_image_write.h](https://github.com/nothings/stb)
- multithreading
- invisible light sources*

To-Do:
- PDFs for optimisation (see "[Ray Tracing - The Rest of your Life](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingTheRestOfYourLife.html)")
- SDFs (see [Inigo Quilez's webpage](https://iquilezles.org/articles/))
- GPU acceleration (see [Roger Allen's upgrade](https://github.com/rogerallen/raytracinginoneweekendincuda))
- animations (maybe using [Physics](https://github.com/Y99dr451l/Physics))
- GUI (Qt or something)
- good folder structure
